# CNN-C

## Introduce

This is a simple cnn program with C.

## Build

Build it with make, and just test by default.
> make CC=gcc \
> make CC=gcc run \

Build it with only training:
> make CC=gcc TRAIN=1 \

Build it with training and test:
> make CC=gcc TRAIN=1 TEST=1

# CNN_C_test
This project is refer to [CNN_C](https://github.com/SunicYosen/cnn_c.git).

This is a CNN program with C to do MAC operation like in in-memory computing module

The model and input images are C data lists. 
* Input data is generated by **CimageConvert.py** sourced from MNIST dataset,
* The weights and bias are generated by **CweightConverter.py**, sourced from **param_decoded.csv**.
* **param_decoded.csv** comes from the [DeepLearningPythonSummer](https://github.com/ShinChoon/DeepLearningPythonSummer.git).
## Generate image data list
> python3 CimageConvert.py > src/headers/imagedata.h 
## Generate weights, bias data list

> python3 CweightConvert.py > src/headers/weights_bias.h

## Compile
> make CC=gcc
## To run the program
> ./build/cnn_test
